### Task 1

Design a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for the Multicommodity flow problem.

### Task 2

<!-- 
The following is based on a tutorial on Lagrangian Relaxation by J E
Beasley [JB].
--> 

Consider the following set covering problem (SCP):

$$
\vec{c} = \begin{bmatrix} 2,3,4,5 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
A=[a_{ij}] = \begin{bmatrix} 1& 0& 1& 0\\
 1& 0& 0& 1 \\
 0 &1 &1 &1 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Mathematically this example SCP is:

$$
\begin{array}{rrl}
\text{minimize}& 2x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 + 5x_4\\
\text{s.t.}& x_1 + x_3 &\geq 1\\
 &x_1 + x_4&\geq 1\\
 &x_2 + x_3 + x_4& \geq 1\\
& x_j\in\{0,1\}&  j=1,...,4
\end{array}
$$


1. Generate a Lagrangian relaxation of this SCP. Write it in general
   terms for a SCP and for the numerical example given. 

2. Let the problem determined at the previous point be called LR
   (Lagrangian relaxation problem or Lagrangian lower bound
   problem). Consider the arbitrarily decided set of values for the
   Lagrangian multipliers $\lambda_1=1.5,\lambda_2=1.6,\lambda_3=2.2$.
   Find the solution to the LR and the corresponding lower bound
   $z_{LR}$ to the original problem.  Is this a lower bound? Is the
   solution found for the LR feasible for the original problem? Is the
   solution found for the LR optimal for the original problem?

  
3. Repeat the task at the point 2. for the set of values: 
   $\lambda_1=10,\lambda_2=10,\lambda_3=10$. Under what
   circumstances does the solutions to the LR being feasible for the
   original problem also imply that it is optimal for the original
   problem?

4. Solve the Lagrangian dual problem by *subgradient
   optimization*. Use the procedure suggested by Held and Karp.

   Set the step size to the value:
   
   $$
   \theta=\mu \frac{z_{UB}-z_{LB}}{\sum_{i=1}^m (\gamma_i)^2}
   $$
   
   where $z_{LB}$ and $z_{UB}$ are the current lower bound and upper
   bound, respectively and $\mu$ an user defined parameter (try with 2
   and decrease it throughout the iterations).
   
   Update $\lambda_i$ using 
   
   $$
   \lambda_i=\max\{\lambda_i+\theta\gamma_i,0\}\qquad i=1,..,m
   $$

   Terminate when $\mu$ has converged to zero. 

   Is the final solution optimal for the original problem?  




### Task 3

Consider the following problem: <!--  from [Fi2]: -->

$$
\begin{array}{lllll}
z_{IP}=&\text{max} &16x_1+10x_2+4x_4\\
&\text{s.t.}&8x_1+2x_2+x_3+x_4\leq 10\\
&&x_1+x_2\leq 1\\
&&x_3+x_4\leq 1\\
&&0\leq x\leq 1 \qquad \text{and integer}
\end{array}
$$

1. Relax only the first constraint and calculate the Lagrangian dual
   bound.
   
2. Relax the second and third constraints and calculate the Lagrangian
   dual bound. Which among the two relaxations provides the best dual
   bound and how do they compare with respect to the dual bound given by
   the linear relaxation of the original problem IP?
