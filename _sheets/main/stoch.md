Yield management

### Task 2

Vehicle Routing with Stochastic Demand (VRPSD)

- Serve all customers.

- The demand of each customer $i$ is given by a
random variable $\xi_i$. The probability distribution
is assumed to be known. We
assume the variables are independent.

- Assume $\xi$ is Poisson distributed.

- Each vehicle has a capacity $Q$.

- We have to plan routes in advance. When
executing the plan it may turn out that we the
planned route violate the capacity constraint.
In that case, the vehicle returns to the depot
to empty/restock the vehicle. 

- We do not do preventive restock.

- Demands become known only when arriving at the customer.

- Often we enforce that the sum of expected
demands on each route should be less than
vehicle capacity

- Objective: Minimize the expected cost of
the solution.

### Task 3

Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Stochastic Travel Times 


As the CVRP but:

- For each arc $(i,j)$ there is an associated
travel time $t_{ij} and travel cost $c_{ij}$

- Here we consider minimizing the cost
$c_{ij}$ of the used arc

- For each customer $i$ there is an
associated service time $s_i$.

- For each node $i$ there is an associated
time window $[a_i,b_i]$.

- Nodes must be visited within their time
windows.

- The vehicle can wait if it arrives too
early

- Assume travel time is a stochastic variable

- We use $\tau_{ij}$ to denote the stochastic variable representing
the travel time on arc $(i,j)$

- Assumptions:

- For simplicity we assume that service time is zero for all
customers [no problem to ”lift” this assumption]

- We assume that the stochastic variables 𝜏𝑖𝑗 are
independent [not very realistic]
