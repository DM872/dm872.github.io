## Sheet 4


### Task 1  -  Home Preparation

From the Sheet 3: compare the results of the DFJ formulation with
cutting plane procedure against:

- the MTZ formulation,
- the Flow with Gain by Svetska and
- the step model by Dantzig

on the instances `dantzig42`, `berlin52.dat`, `bier127.dat`.  Can they
solve the instances? Which of the formulations provides the best lower
bound at the root node?  [You might need to comment out the line for
plotting at each iteration, since it is inefficient. Moreover it might
be convenient not to wait for all $k$'s to be evaluated but to insert
a cut as soon as one is found.]






### Task 2  -  In Class: Cut and Solve

Study the paper on Cut and Solve [CZ]. Implement the cut and solve
method for the traveling salesman problem using the DFJ formulation as
done in that paper. Compare the results with the optimal solutions
from the DFJ and MTZ formulations without cut and solve.
