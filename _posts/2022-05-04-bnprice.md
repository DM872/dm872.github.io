## Sheet 5


### Task 1


Continue the Task 2 from Sheet 4 by designing a branch and price
algorithm. In particular, define the branching scheme and its
implications on the pricing problem. You can try to perform the branch
and price by hand using the methods implemented in the previous sheet or
implement the whole procedure yourself. In gurobi it is not possible to
implement a branch and price algorithm via Callback functions because
the software does not support variable addition at the nodes.
