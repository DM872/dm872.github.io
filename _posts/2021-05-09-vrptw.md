## Assignment 1

This assignment will be graded and will contribute to your final
assessment in the course.

The assignment has to be carried out individually.

To complete the assignment you have to submit in the [LMS] a `.tgz` or
`.zip` archive containing:

- a report in pdf format as concise as possible (by no way more than 10 pages) with the answers to the tasks

- the Python code for the calculations.

A [template]({{ "/assets/template_answers.tex" | absolute_url }}) for the report.




#### Problem Description

This assignment is proposed by courtesy of
[Roberto Roberti](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/roberto-roberti).
The *Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows* (VRPTW) is a
generalization of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where
each customer must be visited within a given time window.  

The VRPTW can be stated as follows. A directed graph $G = (V, A)$ is
given, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $A$ is the set of
arcs. The set of vertices $V$ is defined as $V = N \cup \\left\\{o,
d\\right\\}$, where $N = \\left\\{1, 2, . . . , n\\right\\}$ is a set
of $n$ customers and $o$ and $d$ represent the start and the end point
of each route (in practice, $o$ and $d$ represent the same depot but
are kept separate for notational purposes). The set of arcs $A$ is
defined as $A = \\left\\{(i, j) : i, j \in V, i \neq j\\right\\}$; a travel cost
$c_{ij}$ and a travel time $t_{ij}$ are associated with each arc $(i,
j) \in A$.


Each customer $i \in N$ requests $q_i$ units of a given commodity and
can be visited only within a given time window $[e_i, l_i]$, where $e_i$
and $l_i$ are the earliest and the latest time to serve customer $i$;
nonetheless, a vehicle is allowed to arrive at $i$ before $e_i$, but, in
this case, the service starts at $e_i$. A set $K = \\left\\{1, 2, . . . , m\\right\\}$
of $m$ vehicles can be used to serve the customers; each vehicle has
capacity $Q$.  


The goal of the VRPTW is to find a set of routes of minimum total cost
to assign to the vehicles, such that
- No more than $m$ routes are selected; 
- Each route starts from $o$ within the depot time window, visits a set
of customers, each within its time window, whose total requests do not
exceed $Q$, and ends at $d$ within the depot time window; 
- Each customer is visited by exactly one of the routes.  


You are given a VRPTW instance in Python code at the end of this
document. The layout of the customers is as follows:

#### Task 1: Set Partitioning Formulation

Describe how the VRPTW can be formulated as a Set Partitioning (SP)
problem.


#### Task 2: Heuristic Solution

Find a heuristic solution of the given instance and describe it.

Keep the heuristic simple both implementation-wise and
computationally. A feasible solution is enough. Avoid finding the
optimal solution with the heuristic.  You can describe the procedure
in a few lines and maybe present the picture of the obtained routes
together with giving statistics on the quality of the solution.


#### Task 3: Pricing Problem Formulation

Describe the Master Problem (MP) and the Restricted Master Problem (RMP)
derived from the SP formulation, present and describe a mathematical
formulation of the resulting pricing problem.


#### Task 4: Column Generation by Hand

Starting from the columns defined in the data below, solve the master
problem manually by finding and adding additional columns to the
datafile. You can use a solver for the solution of the master problem
but you must identify promising columns by hand and justify your
choice. 

#### Task 5: Describe and Implement a Column Generation Procedure for the VRPTW

Starting from the provided data below and a template for column
generation delivered during the course (the bin packing example),
implement in Pyhton a Column Generation procedure, computing an
optimal solution to the linear relaxation of the master problem, by
adding the route having the most negative reduced cost, at every
iteration. Use the solution you found in Task 2, as the initial
columns. Describe, in details the different steps implied by the
Column Generation Procedure.

#### Task 6: Cutting

If the optimal MP solution you achieved in Task 4 is fractional, add
Subset-Row inequalities to RMP and resolve using column
generation. Continue adding cuts until no more violated cuts can be
found. Describe the process in detail, and comment on the results.  You
can either do this manually (similar to Task 4), or by implementing it
in the code. 


#### Task 7: Branching 

If the optimal MP solution you achieved in Task 4 is fractional, find an
optimal SP solution by generating a branch-and-bound tree. Describe the
process in detail, visualise the branch-and- bound tree, and comment on
the results.  You can either do this manually (similar to Task 4), or by
implementing it in the code.
