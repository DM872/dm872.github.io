## Sheet 2


### Task 1  -  Home Preparation

+ From the last sheet: compare the results of the DFJ formulation with
cutting plane procedure and the MTZ formulation on the instances
`dantzig42`, `berlin52.dat`, `bier127.dat`.  Can they solve the
instances? Which of the two formulations provides the best lower bound
at the root node?
[You might need to comment out the line for plotting at each iteration, since it is inefficient. Moreover it might be convenient not to wait for all $k$'s to be evaluated but to insert a cut as soon as one is found.]


+ Study the paper on Cut and Solve [CZ]



### Task 2  -  In Class: Cut and Solve

Implement the cut and solve method for the traveling salesman problem
using the MTZ formulation. Compare the results with the optimal
solutions from the DFJ and MTZ formulations without cut and solve.
