## Obligatory Assignment 1


<div style="float: center">
<span style="color: blue">
**Deadline: May 20, 2020, at noon**
</span>
</div>

The goal of this assignment is to implement a MILP model for the
problem of scheduling classes from courses at the faculty of Natural
Science of SDU.  A starting package containing data and code is
available from the directory `CTT` of the repository `Material` in
github.

The goals of the assignment are to:

- model the problem in MILP terms
- describe the model in a written report
- implement the model in Python
- experiment with the data made available and
- report the computational results in the report.  

The project has to be carried out individually. The deliverables, to be
collected in a tar gzip archive and submitted via SDU Assignment in
BlackBoard, are:

- the report (max 7 pages)
- the source code of the implementation.

You do not need to hand in the input data and you should remove large
files generated by your code, eg, `.lp` files. The source code must be
organized as in the `CTT` repository made available. The report must
be placed in a directory called `doc` inside `CTT`. Archive and
compress everything with `tar czvf` and submit via BlackBoard.

<span style="color: red"> You can choose not to put your name or
identifier in any of the files submitted, if your prefer to remain
anonymous during the evaluation. BlackBoard will rename the archive
file that you submit with your exam number. Thus, you will be finally
correctly identified by the exam office. </span>

### Problem description

Given:

- A set of hourly *timeslots* (aka, time periods) $P=\\\{(h,d,w) \mid
    h\in \mbox{Hours}, d\in \mbox{Days}, w\in \mbox{Weeks}\\\}$, that
    is, 10 slots of one hour per day $\times$ 5 days $\times$ 17
    weeks). [File: `timeslots.json`.]

- A set of *events* (aka, classes) $E$. Events are derived from courses,
    weeks, sessions and sections.  Each event has a duration
    $\ell(e)$, $e \in E$ and a week where it has to take place. [File:
    `events.json`.]

- A set of *rooms* $R$. <span style="color: red">Each room has a set
  of timeslots where it is busy (Rooms
  should also have a capacity that makes them suitable or not for a
  course. This important detail will be ignored in this assignment.) [File: `rooms.json`.]</span>

- A *precedence digraph* $D=(E,A)$ where each arc $uv \in A$
    for $u,v \in E$ represents a precedence constraint that $u$ must be
    scheduled before $v$. <span style="color: red">[File: `events.json`, the digraph is given as a list associated to every event denoting the incoming arcs, that is, the events that must be scheduled before.]</span> 

- Two sets of people: a set of *students* $S$, a set of
    *teachers* $T$, together with:

    - a collection of *enrollments* ${\cal Q}=\\\{E_s \subset E \mid s \in
    S\\\}$ that are events a student has subscribed to. [File: `students.json`.]

    - a collection of *teaching duties* ${\cal D}=\\\{D_t \subset E \mid t \in
  T\\\}$. [File: `teachers.json`.] 

    - teacher *unavailabilites* ${\cal U}=\\\{U_t \subset P \mid t \in  T\\\}$. <span style="color: blue">Not available for this assignment.</span>


<!--
- *Preassignments*: schedule of mandatory courses $M=\{(e,r,p) \mid e \in E, r\in R,
    p\in P\}$
-->


Task:

A *timetable* is a schedule of events in timeslots and rooms
throughout the semester.

<span style="color: red">A *conflict* arises if a resource (room,
teacher, student, course) is used by more than one event at a
time.</span>

A timetable is feasible if it satisfies all (hard) constraints given
below.

The task of the assignment is to find a timetable that is feasible and
good with respect to the desirability criteria given below.




Constraints (hard constraints):

- all events are scheduled
- forbidden slots are not used
- resource room: there are no room conflicts
- resource teacher: there are no teacher conflicts. <span style="color: blue">Note: some event does not have a teacher (they should be attended by instructors which are not included in this assignment).</span>
- resource course:
  - the precendences within the weeks are met
  - paired courses are sychronized 
  - <span style="color: red">there is at most one event per course per day for each student</span>
  - <span style="color: blue">(the requirement of no course conflicts was withheld: it is implied by no teacher and student conflicts)</span>

Desirability criteria (soft constraints):

- resource student: student conflicts are minimized 
- resource course: weekly stability is promoted
- resource teacher: the number of events per day per teacher is minimized 
- <span style="color: red">bad slots are avoided in a way proportional to their degree of discomfort (in the figure below, darker shades of green indicate higher undesirability/discomfort).</span>

### Output

Use at most one hour of computation time for any of your models.

You should report in the final document the computational results of
the models you developed. This includes evidence that the solution is
correct, for example by assessing a posteriori that the constraints
are satisfied or reporting statistics on the degree of dissatisfaction
of those that are not satisfied (for example, the soft constraints).
If some constraints create issues (the model becomes to lengthy to
write or the solution becomes too difficult) then remove them and
report the results without them; it is important however that you keep
the mathematical modeling of these constraints in the report.

Report also statistics about the solution process: number of variables
and constraints before preprocessing and after preprocessing, whether
the final solution was optimal, what was the dual bound given by the
linear relaxation and the initial optimality gap, eventually the
development of primal and dual bound through the solution process, and
the number of nodes in the examined in the branch and bound tree.

If you have installed more than one solver you could try solving your
model with different solvers and compare the results (but do not
invest too much time on this).



### Remarks

* To meet the minimum requirements for acceptance your work should at
  least:

  * set up the model correctly for the most important constraints (the
     first four)
     
  * present the model in an understandable and structured way,
     including introduction of the mathematical symbols, mathematical
     expressions, and explanation of the expressions.

  * contain an implementation of the model in one of the solvers
     available and an assessment of the computational results. If the
     implementation does not work there must be an explanation about
     where the problem is.


* An excellent performance includes the minimum requirements for
  acceptance including a correct implementation of all of
  them. Additionally, all constraints are handled. It can still
  contain issues related to the implementation or small mathematical
  imperfections.
