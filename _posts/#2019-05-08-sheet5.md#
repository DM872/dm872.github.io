## Sheet 5


### Task 1


You are the person in charge of packing in a large company. Your job is
to skillfully pack items of various weights in a box with a
predetermined capacity; your aim is to use as few boxes as
possible. Each of the items has a known weights, and the upper limit of
the contents that can be packed in a box is 9 kg. The weight list of
items to pack is given in Table Weights of items to be packed in bins of
size 9. There is no concern with the volume they occupy. So, how should
these items be packed?

Weights of items to be packed in bins of size 9.

|Weights of items to be packed|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 5|

This is an example of a problem called the *bin packing problem*. It can
be described mathematically as follows.

Bin packing problem

There are $n$ items to be packed and an infinite number of available bins
of size $B$. The sizes $0\leq s_i \leq B$ of individual items are assumed to be
known. The problem is to determine how to pack these $n$ items in bins of
size $B$ so that the number of required bins is minimum.

Formulate the problem in a compact formulation and in an extended
formulation. Solve the given example using the extended formulation and
branch and price. A template for your code will be made available
Wednesday afternoon.



```python

def BinPackingExample():
    B = 9
    s = [6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 5]
    return s,B


def FFD(s, B):
    remain = [B]
    sol = [[]]
    for item in sorted(s, reverse=True):
        for j,free in enumerate(remain):
            if free >= item:
                remain[j] -= item
                sol[j].append(item)
                break
        else:
            sol.append([item])
            remain.append(B-item)
    return sol

```
